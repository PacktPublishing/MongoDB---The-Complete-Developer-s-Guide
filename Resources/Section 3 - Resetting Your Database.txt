Resetting Your Database
Important: We will regularly start with a clean database server (i.e. all data was purged) in this course.

To get rid of your data, you can simply load the database you want to get rid of (use databaseName) and then execute db.dropDatabase().

Similarly, you could get rid of a single collection in a database via db.myCollection.drop().
