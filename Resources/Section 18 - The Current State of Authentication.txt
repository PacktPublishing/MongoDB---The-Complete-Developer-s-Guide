The Current State of Authentication
With the currently implemented authentication solution, we're NOT taking advantage of Stitch's automatically managed user tokens. Stitch does store the user tokens in the localStorage and it does detect whether a user is logged in (i.e. if such valid tokens can be found in localStorage) upon initialization.

But we're not using that in our app - instead, we always start off with isAuth: false in App.js.

You could of course change that!

You can add an auth listener (https://s3.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/js/docs/4/interfaces/stitchauth.html#addauthlistener) to Stitch in the constructor (or componentDidMount) of App.js:

Stitch.defaultAppClient.auth.addAuthListener(auth => {
    this.setState({isAuth: auth.isLoggedIn});
})
