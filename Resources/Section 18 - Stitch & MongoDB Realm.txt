Stitch & MongoDB Realm
MongoDB Stitch is now labeled "MongoDB Realm".

The web console also looks a bit different but it works as shown and the code we write also will work as shown - make sure to use the same package as we're installing in the coming lecture (mongodb-stitch-browser-sdk).

One thing that is a bit hidden now => The "Clients" tab which you'll see in the next lectures can now be found under "Clusters" => "Working with your Cluster".
